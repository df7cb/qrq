# Configuration file for qrq by DJ1YFK. Change values as needed. 
# NOTE: Don't leave any spaces between the = and the assigned value.
# for example: dspdevice = /dev/dsp won't work!
# The settings (except dspdevice) can be changed and saved from within the
# program, so there is usually no need to manually change anything here.

dspdevice=/dev/dsp   # your DSP device, usually /dev/dsp, /dev/dsp0 ...

# risetime and falltime for shaping the CW sigs (in milliseconds). recommended
# values: 1..5 see http://fkurz.net/ham/dah.png for an illustration.
# if you have no clue what is is, just leave it ;-)

# waveform. Can be 1 = Sine, 2 = Sawtooth, 3 = Square wave
# Default: Sine. Sawtooth and square wave contain more overtones and may be
# better to hear at very high speeds.
waveform=1   

# constanttone 
# don't change the cw tone pitch
# values: 0,1  (0 = not constant , 1 = constant)
constanttone=0   

# ctonefreq
# frequency of the constant tone
# values: 100 - 1600
ctonefreq=600
