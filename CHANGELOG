                             now.
                           * Added support for building under OpenAL.

0.1.2  -  19. Nov 2007  -  * Speeds are displayed in both WpM and CpM now
                           * Different CW waveforms (sine, sawtooth,
                             squarewave) are now available 
                           * Backspace should now work in all terminals
                           * Added a Perl script ('qrqscore') to synchronize

                           * Added an ugly desktop icon

0.1.1  -  08. Jul 2007  -  * qrq now ensures that it can write to 'qrqrc' and
                             'toplist' after copying it from DESTDIR/share/qrq/
                             to ~/.qrq/
                           * Added all calls of the author's current log to the
                             callsign database; now 20084 unique callsigns.

0.1.0  -  30. Jun 2007  -  User can chose between random CW tone pitch (like
                           before) and a fixed frequency now, which can be set
                           in qrqrc or in the config menu. Tnx DL9PF fr patch!

0.0.7  -  17. Jun 2007  -  Added a timestamp to the toplist-file, which makes
                           it possible to track your training progress.
                           Pressing F7 will generate a graph of score vs.
                           date with gnuplot (if installed).

0.0.6  -  16. Jun 2007  -  Added Makefile. Program looks for its files in
                           different directories now and creates ~/.qrq/
                           unless toplist and qrqrc are in the current
                           directory.

0.0.5  -  29. Jul 2006  -  Settings (speed, mycall, risetimes..) can be
                           changed from within the program now (F5).

0.0.4  -  14. Jul 2006  -  * Bugfix. Waiting for a non-existing thread caused

                             output.
                           * Added a sanity check of values read from the
                             configuration file. It shouldn't be possible to
                             cause any problems by invalid entries anymore.
                           * Several minor bugfixes.
