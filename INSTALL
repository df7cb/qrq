qrq build / installation instructions
-------------------------------------

.------------------------------------------.
| Note: A Windows installer is available   |
|       if you don't like to compile qrq   |
|       by yourself. It can be downloaded  |
|       from https://fkurz.net/ham/qrq     |
|                                          |
|       qrq is also available as a package |
|       in Debian, Ubuntu and FreeBSD      |
`------------------------------------------'

"qrq" can be built for several operating systems, such as 
Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS and Windows.

The main dependencies are:
 * ncurses 
 * libpulse-dev

A Dockerfile to build a Docker image in which qrq can be compiled
for Linux and Win32 is available at: https://git.fkurz.net/dj1yfk/yfkbuild
Even if you don't use this Docker image, you can check which dependencies are
needed from the Dockerfile. These are essentially libncurses5-dev and
libpulse-dev. There's also a .gitlab-ci.yml file contained in the repository
which will produce builds for Linux and Win32.


Step by Step instructions
-------------------------

1. make [DESTDIR=/usr] [USE_PA=NO] [USE_WIN32=NO] [USE_CA=NO] [OSX_PLATFORM=NO] [OSX_BUNDLE=YES]

Compiles qrq.

On Linux/Unix, you can compile against Pulse Audio instead of OSS (USE_PA=YES).

If you are building for OSX set OSX_PLATFORM=YES.  If you want to create the
release as an OSX bundle (recommended), then choose OSX_BUNDLE=YES.

To compile it for Windows with MINGW32, using WinMM, use USE_WIN32=YES.

The executable file, 'qrq[.exe]', will be created in the current directory.
To run, qrq only needs the files 'qrqrc', 'toplist', and 'callbase.qcb',
which are also in the current directory. 

At your option, you can install 'qrq' globally:

2. make install [DESTDIR=/usr] [USE_CA=NO] [OSX_PLATFORM=NO] [OSX_BUNDLE=YES]

By default, DESTDIR=/usr, so the executable will be in /usr/bin, the
callsign database in /usr/share/qrq/ and so on.  You can specify any
other destination directory. However, if you build for OSX and have
OSX_BUNDLE=YES, then make install will *not* install into DESTDIR but
will instead make a bundle called qrq.app in the current directory.
You can then drag and drop the qrq.app into your Applications folder if
you wish. 

So to compile for OSX run

make install USE_PA=NO USE_CA=YES OSX_PLATFORM=YES OSX_BUNDLE=YES

and it will create a qrq.app bundle. 

When starting 'qrq' for the first time, it will copy 'qrqrc' and
'toplist' to ~/.qrq/.

3. If you like, edit the configuration file 'qrqrc' according to your needs.
All values can also be changed from within the program.

'qrq' first searches in the current directory. On platforms other than Windows,
~/.qrq/ and then /usr/share/qrq are also searched for these files, if they were
not found in the current directory.

4. If an older version of 'qrq' is already installed, you don't need to remove
it first.
